# Neural Network Potentials

This repository summarizes popular neural network potentials (NNPs) that serve as efficient replacements for ab initio calculations.

> **Note:** This repository collects and summarizes the NNP models we have used. For the most up-to-date information, please refer to each modelâ€™s specific repository.
